- Update Your Inventory and Manage Donated Plants:

  - Allow users to contribute to your inventory by submitting plant descriptions via a form.
  - Provide a "Submit" button for users to finalize their plant donations.
  - Enable users to view the details of plants they have donated through the form.
  - Offer the option to clear the form and start over by pressing the "Reset" button.
  - Provide a mechanism for customers to remove plants from the donation list if they decide not to donate on the same day, accomplished by clicking the "Remove" button.
  - Implement a feature that allows users to hide donated plants from previous days from other users, with these plants automatically reappearing upon refreshing the page.
  - Facilitate navigation to the inventory section to access the current stock status and update it via a drop-down menu. Note that this stock data resets to default values upon refreshing, as it is populated from a JSON file.
  - Offer a "About Us" page where users can explore your Botanic mission.

Please let me know if you need further assistance or adjustments.
